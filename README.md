TEACHING ASSISTANCE
Objective:
The objective of this project is to predict whether a student requires a teaching assistant based on various academic and engagement-related features using machine learning algorithms.

Dataset Overview:
The dataset includes various features such as:
Discussion, Assignments, Announcements, Resource, Wiki, etc.: Indicators of student activity.
Semester: Indicates term (Spring/Fall).
Age, GradeID, Topic: Demographic and academic info.
Target variable: Class â€“ indicates whether teaching assistance is required (High, Low, Middle).

Data Preprocessing:
Missing Values: The dataset was checked for missing values and cleaned accordingly.
Encoding: Categorical columns were encoded using LabelEncoder to make the data suitable for modeling.
Scaling: StandardScaler was used to normalize the feature distributions.
Feature Selection: The notebook explored correlation between variables and visualized distributions using seaborn and matplotlib.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Count Plots & Distribution Plots helped in understanding class imbalance and feature behavior.
The dataset shows a moderately imbalanced target distribution.

Modeling:

Several classification models were tested:
1. Random Forest Classifier
2. Logistic Regression
3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
4. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
5. XGBoost Classifier

Model Evaluation Metrics:
Accuracy
Confusion Matrix
Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

Best Performing Model:
Random Forest Classifier and XGBoost showed high accuracy and better classification metrics compared to others.

Results:
Accuracy: Around 85-90% (exact values based on model)
Precision/Recall: Reasonably high across all classes
Insights: Features like VisitedResources, RaisedHands, and Discussion were influential in predicting the need for assistance.

Conclusion:
The machine learning models were effective in predicting whether a student would require teaching assistance based on their interaction with course resources and demographic information. Random Forest and XGBoost were the most accurate and robust classifiers for this task.
